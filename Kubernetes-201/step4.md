## How Kubernetes Works

Under the hood, Kubernetes is calling Docker and sending it tasks based off of specifications that a user declares. A user tells Kubernetes what to do with Docker containers via kubectl commands and YAML files, the ways in which you collect information and declare Objects within Kubernetes. Kubectl (pronounced kube control... be careful how you pronounce it, it's a big deal for some) is a command line tool used for interacting with a Kubernetes cluster. Once Kubernetes is told what to do with a container, it takes over from there. You will never need to
use Docker commands with Kubernetes once the image is built. Kubernetes allows you to control where a container runs, the amount of resources it can consume, what applications it can talk to, the number of instances of the container, and much more.
