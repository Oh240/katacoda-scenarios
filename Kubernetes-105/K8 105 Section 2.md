By default, Kubernetes requires data stored in Secrets to be base64 encoded. For the Secret for the username we are going to define, we must first base64 encode the username.
`echo -n 'YWRtaW4=' | base64 
`{{execute}}
---

Apply secret.yml. 

`kubectl apply -f secret.yml
`{{execute}}



Base64 encode the password:
`echo -n 'cGFzc3dvcmQ=' | base64
`{{execute}}

---

Apply the Secrets:
`kubectl apply -f secret.yml
`{{execute}}
