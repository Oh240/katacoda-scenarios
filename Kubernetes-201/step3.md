You don't shut down/reboot/power on containers. Containers are lightweight and can be deployed within a matter of seconds. When you deploy a container, it instantly knows what it needs to do and it does that. If it crashes, a new one can be deployed and running almost immediately. If it is no longer needed, it can be killed and removed almost immediately as well. If built properly, you will never have to "logon" to a container to configure it to get it running. With VMs you experience downtime for patches and updates. With containers any new updates are specified in the Dockerfile.

>>Q2: Select three advantages of containers over virtual machines.<< 
(*) Not having to shut down/reboot/power on containers
() Stonger isolation and security measures 
(*) Fast deployment times
(*) Lack of downtime for patches and updates
() Less sprawl than virtual machines
