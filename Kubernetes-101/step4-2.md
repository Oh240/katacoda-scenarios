## PKS at 84.51

In late 2018, 84.51 purchased licenses for Pivotal Container Service (PKS), Pivotal's managed Kubernetes Platform. Our on-prem Kubernetes clusters are managed by PKS. All cluster related activity such as platform upgrades, node provisioning, authentication, and disaster recovery are controlled via PKS. Within the K8s cluster(s) themselves, actions are performed no different than any other Kubernetes cluster. PKS is not a different version of Kubernetes, rather it is a platform for managing Kubernetes clusters.
