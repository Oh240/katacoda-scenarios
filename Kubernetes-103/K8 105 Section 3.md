The environment variables we defined are the username and password for the Tomcat Manager UI. This is found at http://tomcat-server:8080/manager/html

Exec into the Tomcat Pod and curl localhost/manager and check the response code:
To do this, we first need the name of the Tomcat Pod

`kubectl get pods -l user=a123456
 `{{execute}}
 
 
The below command Exec’s into the Pod, curls localhost, returns output, looks for response code, then exits the exec session:
`kubectl exec -it tomcat-a123456-99464c7d4-lkwxc -- sh -c "curl -is localhost:8080/manager/html | grep HTTP"
`{{execute}}

HTTP/1.1 401
This should return HTTP/1.1 401 because we did not specify a username and password.
The below command Logs in using the username and password defined in the Secret, ensures the -is is lower case and not upper when using curl:

`kubectl exec -it tomcat-a123456-849bbb4c6c-llcg8 -- sh -c "curl –is -u admin:password localhost:8080/manager/html | grep HTTP" HTTP/1.1 200
`{{execute}}
This should return HTTP/1.1 200
