Now that we have a web server running and a service bound to it, we are able to access it from within the Kubernetes cluster. We can test this by deploying a new Pod in the cluster, shelling into it, and then curling the IP or DNS entry for the service.

Deploy the Pod and curl the Service from within the Pod:

`kubectl create ns default
`{{execute}}


`kubectl run -n default -i --rm --restart=Never curl-test --generator=run-pod/v1 --image=radial/busyboxplus:curl -- sh -c "curl -vvv hello-service-a123456.default.svc.cluster.local"
`{{execute}}

---


This method of deploying a Pod and testing connectivity to a Service is a handy troubleshooting technique.
-i : interactive, keep STDIN (standard input) open even if not attached
--rm : delete resources created in this command for attached containers
--restart=Never : creates a Pod by default if generator flag was not specified

curl-test : name of new Pod
--generator=run-pod/v1 : generate resources based on a set of inputs and is used to pin a particular behavior which may change in the future
--image=radial/busyboxplus:curl : this curl image was created as an alternate for those only needing to use curl to extract their configuration in their Hub containers.
-- sh : shelling into the new Pod
-c "curl -Is hello-service-a123456": -c means to run the command that is within the "" in the Pod.
-Is: within curl, the -I (CAPS i) fetch the headers only. The -s means silent or quiet mode which means to not show progress meter or error messages, making curl mute.

We can also access our nginx deployment by using kubectl port-forward. It is worth noting that kubectl port-forward does not require a service as you can bind a Pod's port directly to localhost. kubectl port-forward should only be used for development and testing and is not practical for production deployments. There are other Types of Kubernetes services that are better suited for production.

Port Forward the nginx Pod to localhost:80

`kubectl port-forward $(kubectl get pod --selector="user"="a123456" -o jsonpath={.items[0]..metadata.name}) --address 0.0.0.0 8080:80
`{{execute}}
Forwarding from 0.0.0.0:8080 -> 80 Forwarding from [::1]:80 -> 80

Now you are able to access your nginx Deployment from your browser at localhost by searching for localhost:80. Note that if you delete your Pod, a new one will be deployed by your Deployment, but you will have to re-run the kubectl port-forward command as your pod is now under a different name.

You should see a similar image as shown below when access your nginx Deployment from your browser:

Once you're done, you can remove everything with the below command:
`kubectl delete svc,deploy -l user=a123456
`{{execute}}

It should display “service "hello-service-a123456"

deleted deployment.extensions "hello-web-a123456" deleted”
